        "passingStandard": "Complete 5 hours with 3,000ft gain at 35lb pack while maintaining conversational pace (Z2) for at least 75% of moving time. HR should not require walk breaks to recover on moderate grades. Perceived effort at finish should be 6–7 out of 10 — tired but not destroyed."

        "durationHours": 3.5,
        "passingStandard": "Complete 2,500ft of gain at 35lb pack in under 3.5 hours with no mandatory rest stops. Leg fatigue at finish should be moderate — noticeable but not causing movement compensation or gait changes.",
        "missMeans": "Inability to sustain loaded uphill pace without mandatory rest indicates muscular endurance deficit. On the traverse this shows up as slowing dramatically on afternoon climbs on days 2–3 when fatigue has accumulated."

      "descentDurabilityTest": {
        "description": "Loaded continuous descent on trail, assessing eccentric quad durability under pack weight — the quality most directly predictive of how your legs feel on day 3 of the traverse.",
        "elevationLossFt": 2500,
        "packWeight": "35lb",
        "passingStandard": "Descend 2,500ft at 35lb pack with controlled, consistent pace. Quad burn should be manageable throughout — not requiring stop-and-shake-out breaks. Morning soreness the next day should be mild and resolved within 24 hours.",
        "missMeans": "Severe quad soreness lasting 48+ hours after this test means your descent durability is insufficient. On a 5-day traverse with 3,000–4,000ft of daily descent, this compounds into the injury risk window by day 3."

        "day1Description": "Full loaded day hike: 35lb pack, 3,000ft gain, 3,000ft loss, 6–7 miles. Move at your traverse pace. Note how your legs feel at the end of day.",
        "day2Description": "Repeat the same route or equivalent the following morning, starting within 12 hours of finishing day 1. Do not wait for legs to recover — this is the test.",
        "passingStandard": "Day 2 pace should be within 15% of day 1 pace. Leg fatigue on day 2 should be noticeable but not limiting — you can still move efficiently on descents and maintain climbing pace on moderate grades. If day 2 feels significantly harder than day 1 but you complete it, that's borderline. If you can't maintain form on descents or need frequent rest breaks you didn't need on day 1, that's a miss."

        "day1": "Loaded hike 35lb pack, 3,500ft gain, 3,000ft loss, 7 miles. Move at 80–90% of your objective effort — not all-out. This is a simulation, not a test of maximum output.",
        "day2": "Same format as day 1 — 3,500ft gain, 3,000ft loss, 7 miles at 35lb. Start the day noting how your legs feel relative to yesterday. Do not take extra rest to compensate.",
        "day3": "Reduced day: 2,500ft gain, 2,000ft loss, 5 miles at 35lb. Day 3 is the diagnostic. The reduced distance is intentional — you're testing whether you can still move well when fatigued, not whether you can gut out another full day.",
        "passingStandard": "Day 3 should feel hard but controlled. You should be able to maintain a consistent hiking pace on moderate grades without the descents causing you to brace or shuffle. RPE on day 3 should be no more than 2 points higher than day 1 for the same terrain. If day 3 feels like a survival march from the first mile, your cumulative fatigue tolerance needs more work."

    "readinessTiers": {
      "ready": "You've passed the loaded aerobic test, the back-to-back test, and day 3 of the simulation block felt hard but controlled. Your descent durability test produced only mild next-day soreness. You'll have good days and harder days on the traverse but you won't be fighting your body.",
      "borderline": "You completed the assessments but day 3 of the simulation block was a significant struggle, or your descent durability test produced 48-hour soreness. You'll likely finish the traverse but days 4–5 carry real risk — accumulated quad damage under load with degraded movement quality significantly increases ankle, knee, and fall risk on technical terrain. You'll be managing rather than enjoying.",
      "notReady": "You could not complete the loaded aerobic test at the required duration, or the back-to-back test showed greater than 20% pace degradation on day 2. Attempting this traverse at this fitness level means a high probability of a day 3 or 4 bailout. The combination of altitude, cumulative fatigue, and technical terrain with a 35lb pack under-conditioned legs is an injury and emergency scenario, not just an uncomfortable experience."
